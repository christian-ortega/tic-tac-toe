THE ODIN PROJECT: OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Tic Tac Toe (https://repl.it/@chrisortegax/tic-tac-toe#tic_tac_toe.rb)

This is a command-line interface implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

In this project, I familiarized myself with classes in Ruby and their constituent parts: instance variables, instance methods, private vs. public methods, etc.
