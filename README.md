# tic-tac-toe
THE ODIN PROJECT: OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, TESTING YOUR RUBY CODE

### Tic Tac Toe ([View in repl.it](https://repl.it/@chrisortegax/tic-tac-toe#tic_tac_toe.rb))

This is a command-line interface implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

In this project, I familiarized myself with classes in Ruby and their constituent parts: instance variables, instance methods, private vs. public methods, etc.

### RSpec Testing

This project also features a testing suite that verifies the functionality of the program. You can run the ```rspec``` command in the above link.
